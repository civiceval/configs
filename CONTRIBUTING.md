# Contributing to CivicEval Blueprints

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CivicEval Blueprints repository! Your contributions help us build a comprehensive, open-source resource for understanding how AI models perform on issues vital to a healthy society.

## Our Mission

CivicEval aims to be an independent, public-interest entity. We measure how accurately—and how consistently—language models understand topics such as:

*   Universal human-rights standards
*   The rule of law and core democratic processes in various countries
*   Anti-discrimination principles
*   Charters and founding documents of international bodies, organizations, governments, etc.
*   Other locale-specific or domain-specific topics where AI misrepresentations could cause public harm or erode civic values.
*   Other topics that are important to a healthy society (e.g., climate change, global health, etc.)

Please ensure your contributions align with this mission.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of new evaluation blueprints (`/blueprints/*.json`) and model collections (`/models/*.json`). Please refer to the [main README.md](README.md) for details on the repository structure and how to define these files.

The general workflow for contributions is outlined in the [Contribution Workflow section of the README.md](README.md#contribution-workflow).
