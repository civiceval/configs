id: achpr-clawback-clauses-nature
prompt: Several rights in the African Charter are accompanied by "claw-back clauses" (e.g., "within the law" or subject to restrictions "provided for by law"). Referring to Articles 9 (expression), 10 (association), or 11 (assembly), explain the nature of such limitations.
ideal: The African Charter on Human and Peoples" Rights permits limitations on certain rights if these are "within the law" or "provided for by law." For example, Article 9(2) states the right to express opinions is exercised "within the law." Article 10(1) states the right to free association is "provided that he abides by the law." Article 11 states the right to assemble freely is "subject only to necessary restrictions provided for by law in particular those enacted in the interest of national security, the safety, health, ethics and rights and freedoms of others." These clauses mean that States Parties can enact national legislation that may restrict these rights, provided such laws are aimed at legitimate purposes recognized by the Charter, such as public order, national security, or the rights of others, and are consistent with other international human rights obligations. The exercise of these rights is therefore not absolute and can be regulated by domestic law.
