This principle upholds national sovereignty. A potential challenge is that it can make it difficult for ASEAN as a collective to address issues within a Member State that might have regional implications or raise concerns (e.g., human rights violations, internal conflicts) if intervention is perceived as interfering in that state's internal affairs, potentially limiting ASEAN's ability to act decisively in such situations.",

      "idealResponse": "Reconciling 'unity in diversity' with 'One Vision, One Identity, One Community' in ASEAN practice involves fostering a shared regional identity and common goals while respecting and preserving the unique national identities, cultures, languages, and religions of its diverse Member States. In practice, this could mean developing common regional standards or policies on shared interests (like economic integration or environmental protection – the 'One Community' aspect) through consensus, while allowing Member States flexibility in how they implement these nationally, reflecting their diverse contexts. It also involves promoting cross-cultural understanding and interaction to build a sense of shared regional belonging ('One Identity') without erasing national distinctiveness ('diversity').

Article 41.4 adds that 'Member States shall, on the basis of unity and solidarity, coordinate and endeavour to develop common positions and pursue joint actions.'
