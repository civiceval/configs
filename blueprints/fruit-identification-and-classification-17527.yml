title: Fruit Identification and Classification
description: >-
  Tests a model's ability to identify common fruits, classify them botanically,
  and describe their nutritional benefits.
---
- prompt: >-
    What are three common fruits that are botanically classified as berries, and
    what are their primary nutritional benefits?
  ideal: >
    Three common fruits botanically classified as berries are blueberries,
    cranberries, and grapes. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants, particularly
    anthocyanins, and vitamin K. Cranberries are known for their high vitamin C
    content and proanthocyanidins, which can support urinary tract health.
    Grapes provide antioxidants like resveratrol and are a good source of
    vitamin K and vitamin C.
  should:
    - >-
      Identifies at least three fruits that are botanically true berries (e.g.,
      blueberries, cranberries, grapes, currants, elderberries).
    - >-
      For each identified fruit, accurately lists at least one primary
      nutritional benefit (e.g., antioxidants, vitamin C, fiber).
    - >-
      Clearly states that the listed fruits are botanically classified as
      berries.
  should_not:
    - >-
      Includes fruits that are not botanically true berries (e.g., strawberries,
      raspberries, blackberries, bananas, avocados).
    - Provides incorrect nutritional information for the listed fruits.
    - Fails to mention the botanical classification.
- prompt: >-
    Explain the botanical difference between a 'drupe' and a 'pome', and provide
    two common fruit examples for each category.
  ideal: >
    A drupe is a fleshy fruit with a hard, stony pit or 'stone' containing the
    seed, formed from a single carpel. Examples include peaches and cherries. A
    pome is a fleshy fruit derived from the receptacle of the flower, with the
    seeds contained in a central core, often surrounded by a tough membrane.
    Examples include apples and pears.
  should:
    - >-
      Accurately defines a drupe as a fruit with a hard, stony pit containing
      the seed.
    - >-
      Provides at least two correct examples of drupes (e.g., peach, cherry,
      plum, olive, mango, almond).
    - >-
      Accurately defines a pome as a fruit where the fleshy part is derived from
      the receptacle, with seeds in a central core.
    - >-
      Provides at least two correct examples of pomes (e.g., apple, pear,
      quince, loquat).
  should_not:
    - Confuses the definitions of drupes and pomes.
    - Provides incorrect fruit examples for either category.
    - Omits the botanical origin or structure in the definitions.
- prompt: >-
    Describe the typical ripening process of a climacteric fruit, and name two
    common climacteric fruits. How does this differ from non-climacteric fruits?
  ideal: >
    Climacteric fruits continue to ripen after being harvested, characterized by
    a surge in ethylene production and a rise in respiration rate. This allows
    them to be picked when mature but not yet ripe, and then ripened later. Two
    common climacteric fruits are bananas and avocados. In contrast,
    non-climacteric fruits do not ripen significantly after harvest; they must
    be picked when fully ripe, as they do not produce a surge of ethylene or
    show a significant increase in respiration. Examples include citrus fruits
    and grapes.
  should:
    - Explains that climacteric fruits continue to ripen after harvest.
    - >-
      Mentions the role of ethylene production and/or increased respiration in
      climacteric ripening.
    - >-
      Provides at least two correct examples of climacteric fruits (e.g.,
      banana, avocado, apple, tomato, mango, peach).
    - >-
      Explains that non-climacteric fruits do not ripen significantly after
      harvest and must be picked when ripe.
    - >-
      Highlights the key difference in ethylene production or respiration
      between the two types.
  should_not:
    - Confuses climacteric and non-climacteric ripening processes.
    - Provides incorrect examples for either fruit type.
    - >-
      Fails to explain the underlying physiological mechanism
      (ethylene/respiration).
