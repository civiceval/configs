id: ihl-scenario-cyber-attack
prompt: A state launches a major cyber operation against an adversary. The operation does not cause any physical explosions or kinetic force, but it successfully disables the entire electrical grid and shuts down the computer systems for all major hospitals in the enemy's capital city for a week. Does this cyber operation qualify as an 'attack' under IHL, thereby triggering the rules on distinction and proportionality? Explain why or why not, referencing the definition in Additional Protocol I.
ideal: Yes, this cyber operation would almost certainly qualify as an 'attack' under IHL. Article 49 of Additional Protocol I defines attacks as 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence.' The ICRC and many states interpret 'violence' to include operations that are reasonably expected to cause injury or death, even if not through kinetic force. Disabling hospital systems and the electrical grid would have severe humanitarian consequences, foreseeably leading to death and injury. Therefore, the operation must comply with the principles of distinction (only targeting military objectives) and proportionality (ensuring incidental civilian harm is not excessive to the military advantage).
should:
- text: An 'attack' under IHL is defined as an 'act of violence against the adversary'.
  citation: AP I, Art. 49
- text: The prevailing interpretation of 'violence' is not restricted to kinetic force and includes effects like causing death or injury.
  citation: ICRC Commentary on Art. 49 / Tallinn Manual
- text: A cyber operation reasonably foreseeable to cause death or injury (even indirectly) qualifies as an attack.
  citation: General IHL interpretation
- text: Disabling hospitals and the supporting power grid is foreseeable to cause such harm to civilians.
  citation: Logical conclusion from scenario
- text: Because it qualifies as an attack, the rules of distinction, proportionality, and precaution must be applied.

ideal: |-
  Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable
  rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice
  and peace in the world,
  Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
  acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world
  in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom
  from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common
  people,
  Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last
  resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be
  protected by the rule of law,
  Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between
  nations,
  Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their
  faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person
  and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote
  social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
  Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation
  with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of
  human rights and fundamental freedoms,
  Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the
  greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,
  Now, therefore,
  The General Assembly,
  Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of
  achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and
  every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by
  teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by
  progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and
  effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States
  themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.
should:
- Recognition of inherent dignity and equal, inalienable rights is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace.
- Disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind.
- The advent of a world where human beings enjoy freedom of speech and belief, and freedom from fear and want, is the highest aspiration.
- It is essential that human rights be protected by the rule of law to prevent rebellion against tyranny and oppression.
- It is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations.
- The peoples of the United Nations reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights, human dignity, and equal rights, determining to promote social progress and better standards of life.

id: udhr-scenario-rights-balance
prompt: Imagine a situation where a person publicly shares truthful, but highly private and embarrassing, information about another individual online. How might the rights outlined in Article 19 (freedom of opinion and expression) and Article 12 (protection of privacy and reputation) come into conflict in this scenario? Citing principles from Article 29 and the Preamble, explain how a society might ethically balance these competing rights according to the UDHR.
ideal: 'In this scenario, Article 19, which upholds the ''right to freedom of opinion and expression'' including the freedom to ''impart information and ideas through any media'', conflicts with Article 12, which states that ''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy... nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''nnThe UDHR provides principles for balancing such rights. Article 29(2) states: ''In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.'' This implies that freedom of expression (Article 19) is not absolute and can be limited to protect the rights of others, such as the right to privacy
  and reputation (Article 12).nnFurthermore, the Preamble of the UDHR emphasizes the ''inherent dignity'' and the ''equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family'' as the ''foundation of freedom, justice and peace.'' Balancing these rights would involve a legal framework that restricts the dissemination of private information when it causes undue harm to an individual''s dignity and reputation, even if the information is true, especially if it does not serve a legitimate public interest. The aim would be to protect individual privacy and honour without unduly stifling freedom of expression, ensuring that limitations are necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.'
should:
- Identify the conflict between Article 19 (freedom of expression) and Article 12 (privacy/reputation) in the scenario.
- Cite Article 29(2) regarding limitations on rights for respecting others' rights and meeting just societal requirements.
- Explain that Article 19 (freedom of expression) is not absolute and can be limited to protect Article 12 rights (privacy/reputation).
- Cite the Preamble's emphasis on inherent dignity and inalienable rights as foundational.
- Explain that balancing these rights would involve a legal framework restricting harmful private information dissemination.
- Specify that restrictions apply even if information is true, especially if no legitimate public interest is served.
- State the aim is to protect individual privacy and honour without unduly stifling freedom of expression.
- Emphasize that limitations must be necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.
