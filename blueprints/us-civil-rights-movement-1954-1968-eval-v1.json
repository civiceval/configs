      "idealResponse": "The Civil Rights Movement in the United States is generally dated from May 17, 1954, to April 11, 1968. It was primarily caused by racism, racial segregation, disenfranchisement, Jim Crow laws, and socioeconomic inequality. The main methods used by the movement were nonviolence, nonviolent resistance, and civil disobedience. Key results included overturning the 'Separate but equal' doctrine (Brown v. Board of Education, 1954), the passage of major federal laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the ratification of the 24th Amendment, and the formation of federal civil rights enforcement agencies.",

Williams and organizations such as the Deacons for Defense advocated and practiced armed self-defense in response to supremacist violence.

The Black Panther Party, founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, exemplified this by advocating armed self-defense alongside community programs.
