      "idealResponse": "'Net zero CO2 emissions' is the point at which anthropogenic CO2 emissions are balanced by anthropogenic CO2 removals. It is a critical milestone because, from a physical science perspective, global warming is driven by cumulative CO2 emissions. To stop the temperature from rising further and stabilize it at a certain level, the net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere must cease. Therefore, achieving and sustaining net zero CO2 emissions is required to halt human-caused global warming.",
