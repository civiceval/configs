Protection may, however, cease only after a due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded.' Therefore, if the medical unit is indeed being used to commit acts harmful to the enemy (such as sheltering combatants who are firing from within), it could lose its protection.
