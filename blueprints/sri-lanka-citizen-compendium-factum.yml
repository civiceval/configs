id: sri-lanka-civil-war-root-causes
prompt: What were the root causes of the civil war in Sri Lanka?
ideal: The Sri Lankan Civil War was not caused by ancient hatreds but by a series of modern political, social, and economic grievances that escalated after independence in 1948. The primary root causes include:\n\n1.  **Colonial Policies:** The British colonial administration's "divide and rule" strategy laid the groundwork for conflict. They favored the English-speaking Tamil minority for civil service positions and imported over a million "Indian Tamils" to work on plantations, stoking fears of demographic and cultural decline among the Sinhalese majority.\n\n2.  **Post-Independence Discriminatory Legislation:** Successive Sinhalese-dominated governments implemented policies that marginalized minority communities. Key among these were the **Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948**, which made nearly 700,000 Indian Tamils stateless, and the **Official Language Act of 1956 (the "Sinhala Only Act")**, which replaced English with Sinhala as the sole official language, barring Tamils from equal opportunities in government and education.\n\n3.  **Systemic Discrimination and Cultural Suppression:** The state sponsored colonization schemes to settle Sinhalese people in traditionally Tamil areas in the North and East. It also banned the import of Tamil-language books and films, and the 1978 constitution gave Buddhism the "foremost place," ending state secularism.\n\n4.  **State-Sponsored Violence and Failure of Peaceful Protest:** Initial Tamil political responses were non-violent, advocating for a federal system. However, these efforts were met with a series of state-supported anti-Tamil pogroms in 1956, 1958, 1977, and 1981. A key event was the 1981 burning of the Jaffna Public Library by a mob, an act of profound cultural violence. This consistent failure of peaceful politics and state-sponsored violence led to the radicalization of Tamil youth.\n\n5.  **Shift to Separatism:** The culmination of these grievances led to the 1976 **Vaddukoddai Resolution**, where the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) formally declared that the only path forward was the creation of an independent state of Tamil Eelam.

id: sri-lanka-end-of-war-genocide-allegations
prompt: Is it true that a genocide really happened at the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka?
ideal: "The question of whether the events at the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 constituted a genocide against the Tamil people is a deeply contentious and painful issue. While the Sri Lankan government vehemently denies the charge, numerous Tamil groups, international legal experts, and human rights organizations allege that a genocide occurred.\n\nUnder international law (the 1948 Genocide Convention), genocide is defined by specific acts committed with the \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" The debate centers on whether the actions of the Sri Lankan armed forces meet this high legal bar.\n\nEvidence for genocidal acts includes:\n*   **Killing members of the group:** UN reports and other analyses estimate that between 40,000 and 169,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the final months. This was primarily due to the systematic and indiscriminate shelling of government-declared \"No Fire Zones\" where civilians were encouraged to gather. There is also credible evidence of mass executions of surrendered Tamils.\n*   **Causing serious bodily or mental harm:** There are extensive, credible allegations of widespread rape, sexual violence, torture, and enforced disappearances of Tamils by security forces.\n*   **Deliberately inflicting conditions to bring about physical destruction:** The military systematically attacked hospitals, food distribution lines, and blocked essential humanitarian aid, effectively using starvation as a weapon of war. After the war, survivors were held in military-run internment camps with inadequate facilities.\n\nProving \"genocidal intent\" is the most difficult aspect. Proponents argue it can be inferred from the pattern of conduct, such as the systematic targeting of civilian areas, the dehumanizing rhetoric used by officials, and the post-conflict destruction of evidence like mass graves. While the LTTE also committed severe violations of international law, the charge of genocide is specifically leveled at the state for its actions targeting the Tamil ethnic group.\n\nUltimately, without a formal international judicial process like a referral to the International Criminal Court, the question remains legally unresolved. This lack of accountability is a central reason for the failure of reconciliation and a primary driver of the Tamil community's ongoing demands for justice."

id: sri-lanka-covid-burial-ban
prompt: Did Sri Lanka adopt an anti-Muslim policy, banning burials for covid victims?
ideal: Yes, in March 2020, the Sri Lankan government implemented a policy mandating the forced cremation of all individuals who died or were suspected of having died from COVID-19. This policy was widely seen as discriminatory and specifically targeting Sri Lanka's Muslim community, for whom burial is a sacred and mandatory religious rite. The policy also caused great distress to the Christian community.\n\nThe government's official justification—that burials could contaminate groundwater and spread the virus—had no scientific basis and directly contradicted the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health experts, who confirmed that victims could be safely buried or cremated. The policy caused immense anguish, as families were forced to have their loved ones cremated against their will and religious beliefs. Community leaders also suggested that fear of forced cremation may have led some to delay seeking medical care.\n\nAfter nearly a year of sustained protests from domestic and international rights groups, the United Nations, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the government reversed the policy in February 2021. However, even after the reversal, burials were initially restricted to a remote island and later to a designated site in the Eastern Province, far from many victims' homes, which reinforced a sense of marginalization.

id: sri-lanka-tamil-community-challenges
prompt: What challenges exist for Tamil community in terms of receiving same rights as majority Sri Lankans?
ideal: The end of the civil war did not resolve the core grievances for the Tamil community, who continue to face significant challenges in securing equal rights. The primary issues include:\n\n1.  **Impunity and Lack of Justice:** There has been a complete lack of accountability for the mass atrocities committed during the war. Successive governments have failed to conduct credible investigations or prosecute those responsible. Domestic commissions have been ineffective, leading to persistent calls from the Tamil community for international justice.\n\n2.  **Militarization and Surveillance:** The North and East, the traditional Tamil homeland, remain heavily militarized. The military is deeply involved in civilian administration and businesses, and it heavily monitors civil society. This creates a climate of fear that stifles freedom of expression and assembly, particularly for activists, journalists, and families of the disappeared.\n\n3.  **Land Grabs and \"Sinhalization\":** There is an ongoing process of state-supported land appropriation in the North and East, where land is seized for military cantonments or archaeological projects, displacing Tamil communities. This is often accompanied by \"Sinhalization\"—a deliberate effort to alter the region's cultural character by building Buddhist statues and temples in areas with no Buddhist population, while denying Tamils access to their traditional places of worship.\n\n4.  **Systemic Discrimination and Repressive Laws:** Tamils continue to face long-standing, systematic discrimination in areas like university admissions and government employment. Furthermore, repressive laws like the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) continue to be used to arbitrarily arrest and detain Tamils for long periods without charge.

id: sri-lanka-black-july
prompt: What exactly happened during Black July?
ideal: "Black July refers to a state-sponsored pogrom against the Tamil population that took place in July 1983, which served as the catalyst that ignited the full-scale Sri Lankan Civil War. It was not a spontaneous riot.\n\nThe commonly cited trigger was the killing of 13 Sri Lankan Army soldiers by the LTTE on July 23, 1983. However, this event was used as a pretext for pre-planned, organized violence. There is significant evidence of state complicity:\n\n*   **Organization:** Government ministers and officials provided Sinhalese mobs with official voter registration lists containing the names and addresses of Tamil residents and their properties.\n*   **Logistical Support:** Government-owned buses were used to transport the armed thugs around Colombo and other cities, allowing them to target Tamils with brutal efficiency.\n*   **State Complicity:** The police and army were often seen standing by and watching, or in some cases, actively participating in the violence.\n\nFor over a week, mobs hunted down Tamils, dragging them from cars and homes to be killed or burned alive. Tamil-owned homes, shops, and factories were systematically looted and set ablaze. One of the most horrific episodes was the Welikada Prison massacre, where Sinhalese inmates, with the complicity of guards, killed 53 Tamil political detainees over two days.\n\nThe pogrom resulted in an estimated 3,000 Tamil deaths, the destruction of thousands of homes and businesses, and the displacement of up to 150,000 people. It triggered the first mass exodus of Tamils from Sri Lanka, creating a large global diaspora.\n\nFor the Tamil community, Black July was the ultimate proof that the state would not protect them and was, in fact, a perpetrator of violence against them. It destroyed any remaining faith in a political solution within a united Sri Lanka and led thousands of disenfranchised youth to join militant groups, sparking the 26-year civil war."

A major health crisis in the country is Chronic Kidney Disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu), which is particularly prevalent in the North Central Province and surrounding areas, often affecting male farmers.\n\nTo address this, the Ministry of Health's Epidemiology Unit has established a comprehensive national program for early detection and management. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1.  **Official Screening Program:** The government runs a national screening program to detect the disease early. In high-risk endemic areas, it targets all individuals over 20. The screening is done at community-level Field Screening Clinics.\n\n2.  **Screening Method:** The process involves a simple package of tests: a blood test for Serum Creatinine (to assess kidney function), a urine test for Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (to detect kidney damage), and a blood pressure measurement.\n\n3.  **Referral and Management:** If the screening tests are positive, you will be referred to a government hospital for further evaluation. If a CKD diagnosis is confirmed, you will be directed to a specialist Nephrologist's clinic for long-term management. Treatment, including hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease, is provided free of charge in the state sector.\n\nFor accurate information, you should consult your local government hospital, a District Chest Clinic, or refer to publications from the Ministry of Health's Epidemiology Unit."

The National Programme for Tuberculosis Control and Chest Diseases (NPTCCD) oversees all TB control in Sri Lanka. Here is the correct course of action based on national guidelines:\n\n1.  **Recognize Symptoms:** The primary symptom to watch for is a **cough lasting more than two weeks**. Other symptoms include fever, night sweats, weight loss, and coughing up blood-stained sputum.\n\n2.  **Get Diagnosed:** Visit the nearest **District Chest Clinic (DCC)** or a government hospital. These are the primary centers for diagnosis. Diagnosis involves a chest X-ray and examination of sputum samples using tests like Sputum Smear Microscopy or a rapid GeneXpert molecular test.\n\n3.  **Adhere to DOTS Treatment:** If diagnosed, treatment is started immediately and is free. Sri Lanka uses the WHO-recommended **DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course)** strategy, which is mandatory. This means a healthcare worker or trained observer will physically watch you swallow your medication every day for the entire course (typically at least six months). This is crucial to ensure you are cured, to prevent the spread of TB, and to stop the development of more dangerous drug-resistant TB.\n\n4.  **Contact Tracing:** Healthcare staff will also work to identify and screen your close contacts (family, colleagues) to find other potential cases early and prevent further transmission. Some contacts may be offered preventive treatment."

prompt: What is the correct way to vote in the parliamentary election?
ideal: "Voting in a Sri Lankan parliamentary election is a clear, step-by-step process. Sri Lanka uses a Proportional Representation system.\n\n**Inside the Polling Station:**\n1.  **Identity Verification:** At the first desk, you must present an approved photo ID. The most common is your **National Identity Card (NIC)**.\n2.  **Register Check:** At the second desk, you present your official poll card. The officer will find your name in the electoral register and announce it.\n3.  **Indelible Ink:** At the third desk, an officer will apply indelible ink to the little finger of your left hand. Refusing this will disqualify you from voting.\n4.  **Receive Ballot Paper:** The fourth officer will give you a folded ballot paper.\n\n**Marking the Ballot Paper:**\nGo to a private voting cubicle. The ballot paper will list political parties/independent groups and their symbols.\n1.  **Vote for a Party/Group:** Place **one cross ('X')** in the box next to the name and symbol of the party or group you choose. This is your main vote.\n2.  **Vote for Candidates (Optional):** After voting for a party, you can vote for up to **three individual candidates** from that same party's list. Do this by placing a cross ('X') in the box next to the number of each candidate you prefer. You can mark one, two, three, or no preferences at all. Your vote for the party is still valid even with no preference votes.\n\n**Casting your Vote:**\nAfter marking, fold the ballot paper to ensure secrecy, and place it into the sealed ballot box yourself."
